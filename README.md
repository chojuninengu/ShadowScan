# 🕵️‍♂️ ShadowScan

> **Your AI-powered digital footprint scanner — reclaim your privacy, one search at a time.**

ShadowScan is a secure, Rust-powered privacy guardian that scans known data aggregation sites for your personal information (name, email, phone) and generates takedown request templates to help you remove it.

## 🔒 Goals
- Reveal your exposed personal data on public broker sites
- Use AI for smart matching and privacy scoring
- Generate auto-filled takedown templates (GDPR/CCPA compliant)
- Fully open-source, privacy-respecting

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Rust + Axum (web server, scanner logic)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, basic JS (upgradeable to Yew)
- **AI Entity Matching:** Rust NLP libs (or FFI bridge to Python if needed)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages + Railway/Render for backend
